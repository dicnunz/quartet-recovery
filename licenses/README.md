# OpenScore String Quartets for Optical Music Recognition (OSSQ-OMR)

Fork of [OpenScore String Quartets Mirror](https://github.com/OpenScore/StringQuartets) optimized for Optical Music Recognition (OMR)

[OpenScore String Quartets Mirror](https://github.com/OpenScore/StringQuartets) is a collection of string quartets by "long 19th century" composers in MuseScore format with associated data.

**!Important NOTE!**  
To render or convert .mscx files in this repo, you **need to use MuseScore3 v3.6.2**  

## Part of the String Quartet OMR Benchmark

OSSQ-OMR is the dataset behind the paper. This repository holds the tracked MuseScore/MusicXML annotation sources; related repositories in the release:

- **[string-quartet-omr-benchmark](https://github.com/MALerLab/string-quartet-omr-benchmark)**: umbrella entry point for the paper and the full repository constellation.
- **[ossq-omr](https://github.com/MALerLab/ossq-omr)**: the OSSQ-OMR dataset — MuseScore/MusicXML annotation sources and their revision history. *(this repository)*
- **[omr-data-preprocessor](https://github.com/MALerLab/omr-data-preprocessor)**: the preprocessing pipeline that builds every derived symbolic format from the dataset sources.
- **[sqomr](https://github.com/MALerLab/sqomr)**: model training and evaluation experiments.
- **[lmxe](https://github.com/MALerLab/lmxe)**: the LMXE symbolic format library (derived from [OMR-Research/lmx](https://github.com/OMR-Research/lmx)).

# What this repository tracks

This git repository is the **auditable revision history of the MuseScore annotation work** behind OSSQ-OMR, not a distribution channel for the full multi-format dataset. `git ls-files` tracks 878 files:

- the MuseScore/MusicXML source annotations (`sq<id>.mscx`, `sq<id>.musicxml`, `sq<id>_cleaned.musicxml`, and `sq<id>_scanned.csv` alignment data where a scanned exemplar exists)
- per-composer and per-score `README.md` files
- corpus-level metadata under [`data/`](./data/) (`.tsv`/`.yaml`)
- per-score image-segmentation metadata (`sq<id>_yolo_infos.yaml`)

All *derived* symbolic formats are intentionally gitignored, since they are large, and fully reproducible from the tracked sources:

```
scores/*/*/abc/
scores/*/*/krn/
scores/*/*/lmxe/
scores/*/*/musicxml/    # segmented systemwise/partwise MusicXML; not the top-level sq<id>.musicxml
scores/*/*/metadata/
versions/               # entire directory: packaged builds of past dataset versions
```

The bulk derived artifacts — rendered PDFs/images and the symbolic formats (`.lmxe`/`.plmxe`/`.rlmxe`, `.krn`/`.ekrn`, `.abc`/`.eabc`) — are published separately:

- **Zenodo** (versioned DOI): <!-- TODO: Zenodo DOI --> (link TBD)
- **Hugging Face**: (link TBD)

See [Regenerating derived formats](#regenerating-derived-formats) below to build them yourself instead.

# Provenance and audit history

The git history in this repository *is* the auditable record of the annotation work: every
alignment fix, correction, and style decision applied to a score is a commit. That history
spans many divergent branches — different alignment passes, annotation-style experiments, and
release snapshots — rather than a single linear trunk, because each approach is kept
individually inspectable instead of being squashed away.

The single most useful command for tracing a score's provenance is:

```sh
git log --all --source --oneline -- <path/to/score>
```

This walks every branch in a full clone (not just the default branch — see the warning below)
and labels which branch each commit came from. See [`BRANCHES.md`](./BRANCHES.md) for the full
branch inventory, verified commit counts, and more tracing commands, including why **GitHub's
web history UI only shows the default branch** and won't give you this picture on its own.

# Regenerating derived formats

Everything under `scores/*/*/{abc,krn,lmxe,musicxml,metadata}/` is reproducible from the tracked MuseScore/MusicXML sources using the [omr-data-preprocessor](https://github.com/MALerLab/omr-data-preprocessor) pipeline (`omrdp`).

Each pipeline script sets a `BASE_DIR` pointing at a local checkout of this repository. See that repo's README for full setup and its numbered pipeline (`ossq_step_001.sh` through `ossq_step_005.sh`, plus the crawl/download steps) that in turn produces the images, LMXE/PLMXE/RLMXE, **kern/eKern and ABC/eABC formats.

Directories:

- `<composer>` - composer's name in the form `Last,_First_Second...`.
- `<set>` - name of the extended work that the song belongs to, if any.

The top-level `search`/`search_id`/`search_img` shell scripts are developer helpers for looking up a score's derived files by MuseScore ID during pipeline work; they aren't required to use the dataset.

## Filenames

Score files within each song directory are named as follows

```
sq<id>.mscx
```

Filename components:

- `sq` - standing for string quartets
- `<id>` - the score's unique Musescore ID
- `.mscx` - the file extension for MuseScore's uncompressed score format.

## Unicode characters in file paths

With the exception of a few unsafe or illegal characters, names of songs,
sets and composers have been left in their original forms.

Modern filesystems should have no problems with Unicode characters in
file paths. If the paths are displayed incorrectly by `git`, try setting:

```
git config core.quotePath false
```

Users on macOS may also need to set:

```
git config core.precomposeunicode true
```

__Tip:__ Add `--global` after `config` in the above commands to make `git`
behave this way by default for all repositories on your local machine.
